# fh_home_coding_task

Responsive frontend design assignment.

## Documentation

This project was developed in Flutter 2.10.2.

It was tested on various iPads and mainly on Google Chrome (web). On these devices it was fully functional and responsive. For iPads and iPhones, it works best in a horizontal landscape, and for the Web, it works best at >75% full screen.

IDE used for development: Visual Studio Code

The project architecture was inspired by my previous work and apps that I worked on during my Flutter career. I followed a CLEAN coding principle and tried to create as much reusable and readable code as possible.
